QuickBooks Payments PHP SDK
==========================
![Build status](https://travis-ci.com/intuit/PHP-Payments-SDK.svg?branch=master)

This SDK is designed to facilitate developers using QuickBooks Online Payments API. It provides a set of methods that make it easier to work with Intuitâ€™s Payments API. It supports the following operations:

 - Standard OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocols
 - Interceptors for logging and error handling
 - Standard Payments API endpoints requests/response handling

If you have not used with QuickBooks Online Payments API, please go to our docs at: https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbpayments/docs/get-started

## Requirements

   1. PHP 7.0.0 and later.
   2. App for QuickBooks Online Payments API.


## Composer

You can install the bindings via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). Run the following command:

```php
composer require quickbooks/payments-sdk
```

To use the bindings, use Composer's [autoload](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading):

```php
require "vendor/autoload.php";
```

## Manual Installation

If you do not wish to use Composer, you can download the [latest release](https://github.com/intuit/PHP-Payments-SDK/releases). Then, to use the bindings, include the `init.php` file.

```php
require_once('/path/to/init.php');
```

## Dependencies

The bindings require the following extensions in order to work properly:

- [`curl`](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php), although you can use your own non-cURL client if you prefer
- [`json`](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.json.php)

If you specify the Guzzle client, then Guzzle is also required.

If you use Composer, these dependencies should be handled automatically. If you install manually, you'll want to make sure that these extensions are available.

## Getting Started

To begin using the Payments SDK, the first step will be creating a PaymentClient with the two minimum propertis, `access_token` and `environment`. The `access_token` is the OAuth 2.0 token to access the API, the `environment` is defining the base url for the API endpoint, either sandbox or production. If you don't provide these two properties, `PaymentClient` can still be created, however, it won't be able to make any Payments API call.

```php
$client = new PaymentClient([
 'access_token' => "your access token",
 'environment' => "sandbox" //  or 'environment' => "production"
]);
```
Once the Payment Client is created, you can start making API calls to the Payments API endpoints. Simple usage looks like:

```php
<?php
require "vendor/autoload.php";

use QuickBooksOnline\Payments\PaymentClient;
use QuickBooksOnline\Payments\Operations\ChargeOperations;


$client = new PaymentClient([
  'access_token' => "your access token",
  'environment' => "sandbox" //  or 'environment' => "production"
]);

$array = [
  "amount" => "10.55",
  "currency" => "USD",
  "card" => [
      "name" => "emulate=0",
      "number" => "4111111111111111",
      "address" => [
        "streetAddress" => "1130 Kifer Rd",
        "city" => "Sunnyvale",
        "region" => "CA",
        "country" => "US",
        "postalCode" => "94086"
      ],
      "expMonth" => "02",
      "expYear" => "2020",
      "cvc" => "123"
  ],
  "context" => [
    "mobile" => "false",
    "isEcommerce" => "true"
  ]
];
$charge = ChargeOperations::buildFrom($array);
$response = $client->charge($charge);

if($response->failed()){
    $code = $response->getStatusCode();
    $errorMessage = $response->getBody();
    echo "code is $code \n";
    echo "body is $errorMessage \n";
}else{
    $responseCharge = $response->getBody();
    //Get the Id of the charge request
    $id = $responseCharge->id;
    //Get the Status of the charge request
    $status = $responseCharge->status;
    echo "Id is " . $id . "\n";
    echo "status is " . $status . "\n";
}

```

If the request is made successfully, then the `getBody()` function will return the casted object. The above example will return the following `$responseCharge` object from `$response->getBody()`:
```php
class QuickBooksOnline\Payments\Modules\Charge#11 (19) {
  public $status =>
  string(8) "CAPTURED"
  public $amount =>
  string(5) "10.55"
  public $currency =>
  string(3) "USD"
  public $token =>
  NULL
  public $card =>
  class QuickBooksOnline\Payments\Modules\Card#12 (18) {
    public $updated =>
    NULL
    public $name =>
    string(9) "emulate=0"
    public $number =>
    string(16) "xxxxxxxxxxxx1111"
    public $address =>
    class QuickBooksOnline\Payments\Modules\Address#13 (5) {
      public $streetAddress =>
      string(13) "1130 Kifer Rd"
      public $city =>
      string(9) "Sunnyvale"
      public $region =>
      string(2) "CA"
      public $country =>
      string(2) "US"
      public $postalCode =>
      string(5) "94086"
    }
    public $commercialCardCode =>
    NULL
    ...
```

Each casted object will have the same property names as stated in our API reference: https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbpayments/docs/api/resources/all-entities/charges page,

If the request is failed due to token expired, server outrage, or invalid request body, use `$response->failed()` method to check if the request failed. Check with our [Response Interface](https://github.com/intuit/PHP-Payments-SDK/blob/master/src/HttpClients/Response/ResponseInterface.php) for a list of supported operations to diagnose a failed request. 

## OAuth support

Developers can use this library to handle OAuth 2.0 protocol. It supports:
- Generating Authorization URL             
`generateAuthCodeURL(string $scope, string $userDefinedState = "state") : string`
- Getting OAuth2 Bearer Token              
`createRequestToExchange(string $code) : RequestInterface`  
- Getting User Info                        
`createRequestForUserInfo(string $accessToken) : RequestInterface`
- Refreshing OAuth2 Token                  
`createRequestToRefresh(string $refreshToken) : RequestInterface`
- Revoking OAuth2 Token                    
`createRequestToRevoke(string $token)`
- Migrating tokens from OAuth1.0 to OAuth2 
`createRequestToMigrateToken(string $consumerKey, string $consumerSecret, string $oauth1AccessToken, string $oauth1TokenSecret, string $scopes) : RequestInterface`

In order to use OAuth 2, developers will need to create two objects
 - OAuth2Authenticator : used to create OAuth 2.0 related request
 - PaymentClient: used to send OAuth 2.0 related request
 
The Payments SDK does not provide any parsing support for parsing the OAuth 2.0 response. Since the response for OAuth 2.0 requests are always in JSON format, a simple `json_decode($response->getBody(), true)` will work.

Example:
```php
<?php
require "vendor/autoload.php";

use QuickBooksOnline\Payments\OAuth\OAuth2Authenticator;
use QuickBooksOnline\Payments\PaymentClient;

$client = new PaymentClient();
$oauth2Helper = OAuth2Authenticator::create([
  'client_id' => 'Your Client ID',
  'client_secret' => 'Your Client Secret',
  'redirect_uri' => 'The redirect URI under the app's Keys tab',
  'environment' => 'development' // or 'environment' => 'production' 
]);

//The scope for the token. 
$scope = "com.intuit.quickbooks.accounting openid profile email phone address";

$authorizationCodeURL = $oauth2Helper->generateAuthCodeURL($scope);
//Sample URL: https://appcenter.intuit.com/connect/oauth2?client_id=L0vmMZIfwUBfv9PPM96dzMTYATnLs6TSAe5SyVkt1Z4MAsvlCU&scope=com.intuit.quickbooks.accounting%20openid%20profile%20email%20phone%20address&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.intuit.com%2Fv2%2FOAuth2Playground%2FRedirectUrl&response_type=code&state=JBAJE

//Redirect User to the $authorizationCodeURL, and a code will be sent to your redirect_uri as query paramter
$code = $_GET['code'];
$request = $oauth2Helper->createRequestToExchange($code);
$response = $client->send($request);
if($response->failed()){
  $code = $response->getStatusCode();
  $errorMessage = $response->getBody();
  echo "code is $code \n";
  echo "body is $errorMessage \n";
}else{
  //Get the keys
  $array = json_decode($response->getBody(), true);
  $refreshToken = $array["refresh_token"];
  //AB11570127472xkApQcZmbTMGfzzEOgMWl2Br5h8IEgxRULUbO
}

```

## Operations

The PHP Payments SDK supports all six Payments endpoints: `BankAccounts`, `Cards`, `Charges`, `EChecks`, `Tokens`, `Transactions` that mentioned in the docs: [API Reference](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbpayments/docs/api/resources/all-entities/bankaccounts#create-a-bank-account-from-a-token).

To construct the body for each API endpoint, developers will need to first construct the body of the request in array format, then use the `Operations`'s `buildFrom` method to convert the array to object.

For example, to convert an array representation of card to a $card object, use:
```php
CardOperations::buildFrom($cardarray);
```

All supports `operations` are availble here: [Operations](https://github.com/intuit/PHP-Payments-SDK/tree/master/src/Operations)

Once the object is created, you will use the `$client` corresponding functions call to send the request. The function names of all the endpoints are derived from the doc. For example To create a card, you will use:
```php
$client->createCard($card);
```

If you want to provide a customer Request-Id for the request, use:
```php
$client->createCard($card, $requestId);
```
otherwise, a system generated random request ID will be provided.

To check a list of available functions, refer to here: [API endpoints operations](https://github.com/intuit/PHP-Payments-SDK/blob/master/src/PaymentClient.php)


## Interceptors

Interceptors are used to intercept requests and response. It can be used to log a request/response, creating a retry mechanism if a connection timeout, or handing token expiration cases.

The default interceptors provided in this SDK are:
 - StackTraceLoggerInterceptor: 
     Similar to log4j, logging the stackTrace to a log file.
 - RequestResponseLoggerInterceptor: 
     log the complete request and response sent/received each time. Hide the OAuth 2.0 token. The StackTraceLoggerInterceptor     will log everything to one error log, however, RequestResponseLoggerInterceptor will record each request in a file, and each response in a file.
 - ExceptionOnErrorInterceptor: 
     throw an exception if the request failed. 

Based on the need, you can define your own interceptors to intercept request and response by inheriting the  `InterceptorInterface`:
- To change the request sent to the Payments API, define your `before(RequestInterface &$request, PaymentClient $client)` method.
- To change the response received, define your `after(ResponseInterface &$response, PaymentClient $client)` method. 
- To intercept the request and response, but don't alter them, define your `intercept(RequestInterface $request, ResponseInterface $response, PaymentClient $client)` method.

In order to add an interceptor to the client, use:

```php
$client->addInterceptor("interceptorName", new InterceptorImplementation());
```

To delete an interceptor by its name, use:

```php
$client->removeInterceptor($name);
```

Example:
To enable file storage for each acutal request and response sent by the SDK:
```php
$client->addInterceptor("requestresponselogger", new RequestResponseLoggerInterceptor("/your/directory/to/store/files", 'America/Los_Angeles'));
```

To enable logging each transaction sent by the SDK:
```php
$client->addInterceptor("tracelogger", new StackTraceLoggerInterceptor("/your/file/to/log/the/transaction", 'America/Los_Angeles'));
```


## Error Handling

By default, each `$response` object will have a `failed()` method to determine if a request is made successful. A successful request is defined by having a status code of 200/201. Any other status code will cause a `$response->failed()` method return true. If a request failed, you can use our [supported diagnose function](https://github.com/intuit/PHP-Payments-SDK/blob/master/src/HttpClients/Response/ResponseInterface.php) to find out more information.
